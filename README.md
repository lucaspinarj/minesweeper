Minesweeper Game 

This is like a story of this project

I think I'm going to make a diary of this project, because I have some ideas for it. I have already seem something similar working by terminal, but now that I learned how observers and listeners work I need to use them as a feature in my code through Swing. I also just learned about SOLID, GRASP and GoF, I'll give them a try.

I find this "diary" idea very fun, challenging and motivating, since that is not the only project I'll be working on those days.

Here you are going to see everything I think, may add, remove, change and I'm even thinking of uploading paper diagrams and brainstorming sketches, even if the commit is not made, but I did work on the project, there will be updates.

* 09/07/2022 01:12 - I've just started the very basics of the project, the skeleton as they are: the packages and some classes (not yet all of them) and I also implemented the JUnit5 testcases, I'm not very well familiar with, but I will give them a try to reach at least +80% approved match. Unfortunately, I'm not going to be able to commit this entire basic part, because It's late and I'm in need of sleep to sleep. Let's keep going then later!
